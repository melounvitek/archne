## UPDATE: project terminated
It was fun, but I don't have the time to maintain my own Hyprland sitro. Since Omarchy appeared, I moved to that, and use a few small tweaks from Archne there.

```bash
 bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melounvitek/archne/main/omarchy_install.sh)
```

## About
Archne is my one‑command configurator for a clean Arch Linux install: it sets up Hyprland, my core tools and optional extras (Ruby via Mise, Docker, Neovim, etc.).

## Install on clean Arch LInux installation
```bash
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melounvitek/archne/main/install.sh)
```
